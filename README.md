üöÄ Project Acquirer AI: Your Automated Project & Lead Generation Engine
Stop Chasing, Start Winning.

In the competitive landscape of IT and service provision, finding the next project shouldn't be a manual chore. It should be an automated, intelligent, and highly efficient process. Too many sales and business development teams are still sifting through countless job postings, trying to manually identify companies in need of their services. This is slow, inefficient, and costly.
Introducing Project Acquirer AI: The revolutionary solution that transforms your project acquisition strategy from reactive and manual to proactive, precise, and AI-driven.
Project Acquirer AI isn't just a scraper; it's your dedicated, 24/7 AI-powered business development assistant. It intelligently identifies and qualifies potential projects and leads from leading job boards like Indeed, matching them against your company's service offerings and expertise with unparalleled accuracy. Say goodbye to guesswork and hello to a pipeline filled with high-probability opportunities.


üéØ What is Project Acquirer AI?

Project Acquirer AI is an advanced, stealthy web automation tool designed to streamline and automate the process of identifying potential clients and projects for IT service providers, consulting firms, staffing agencies, and any business that leverages job postings for lead generation.
It mimics human behavior, bypasses sophisticated bot detection, and leverages cutting-edge AI to pinpoint opportunities that perfectly align with your company's "resume" ‚Äì your service offerings, technologies, and expertise. All configurations are managed effortlessly through a simple Google Sheet, putting you in complete control without touching a single line of code.
‚ú® The Game-Changing Features for Sales & Business Development Teams

1. AI-Powered Hyper-Targeting & Qualification
Intelligent Matching: Forget manual keyword searches. Our system uses advanced Generative AI (Gemini/Groq) to read thousands of job descriptions and compare them against your company's capabilities (defined by your "AI Prompt" and "Resume" in the configuration).
Precision Scoring: Each potential project receives a quantifiable "matching percentage," allowing your team to focus exclusively on the highest-probability leads (e.g., only show me projects with >80% match!). This isn't just a filter; it's a qualified lead score.
Customizable AI Prompt: Tailor the AI's understanding of your services. Do you offer Cloud Migration, Custom Software Development, Cybersecurity Consulting, or Staff Augmentation? Tell the AI exactly what you're looking for, and it will find it.

2. Automated Lead Generation at Scale
24/7 Opportunity Discovery: The scraper continuously monitors job boards, identifying new projects the moment they're posted, giving you a crucial first-mover advantage.
Eliminate Manual Searching: Free up your sales team from tedious, repetitive tasks. Let them focus on what they do best: building relationships and closing deals, not hunting for leads.
Vast Lead Volume: Process hundreds or thousands of job listings in a fraction of the time it would take a human, ensuring no high-value opportunity slips through the cracks.

3. Unrivaled Stealth & Reliability
Sophisticated Anti-Detection: Equipped with Playwright Stealth, unique browser fingerprints, rotating proxies, and human-like interaction simulations, our system operates discreetly and reliably.
Cloudflare Bypass: Automatically navigates complex bot protection mechanisms, including Cloudflare challenges, ensuring uninterrupted data flow.
Duplicate Prevention: Intelligently tracks processed jobs to avoid redundant leads and ensure your team always sees fresh opportunities.

4. Effortless Management & Reporting
Google Sheet Control Panel: Manage all scraper settings ‚Äì target URLs, company ignore/confirmation lists, matching thresholds, and even your AI prompt ‚Äì directly from a simple, shared Google Sheet. No coding required!
Categorized Output: Projects are automatically categorized into "Easy Apply," "Company Site Apply," and "Confirmation Companies," ready for your team to act on.
Automated Google Sheet Upload: All qualified leads are automatically uploaded to designated Google Sheets, sorted by matching percentage for immediate prioritization.
Comprehensive Debugging & Email Alerts: Receive automated email reports with debugging screenshots and detailed logs, ensuring transparency and quick issue resolution even when running unattended.

5. Business Development Focused Filtering
Company Prioritization: Highlight "Confirmation Companies" for special attention or automatically "Ignore Companies" that are not a good fit for your services.
Job Redundancy Control: Limits the number of jobs collected per company, preventing overload and focusing on diverse opportunities.
Keyword Exclusion: Automatically skips jobs related to specific areas (e.g., "government," "clearance") if they don't align with your business model.

üí° How It Works (Simplified for Business Leaders)
Configuration (Google Sheet): You define your target job search URLs (e.g., "Indeed search for 'Software Engineer' in 'New York'"), set your AI matching criteria (your "company resume" and what kind of projects you're looking for), and specify any companies to prioritize or ignore.
Automated Scanning (Indeed): The system launches multiple, "stealthy" browsers that visit these URLs, appearing as real users.
AI Qualification: Each job description found is sent to our AI engine. The AI instantly assesses how well that job's requirements align with your defined services/expertise, generating a "matching percentage."
Smart Filtering: Only jobs that meet your minimum matching percentage and other criteria (e.g., not from ignored companies) are selected.
Data Organization: The details of these qualified projects (company, title, description, your matching score, etc.) are then structured and saved.
Real-time Reporting (Google Sheets): The qualified leads are automatically uploaded to dedicated sheets in your Google Workbook, ready for your sales team to review, prioritize, and pursue.
Continuous Cycle: The process repeats, ensuring your team always has a fresh, qualified pipeline.
