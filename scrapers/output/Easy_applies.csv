Remote",,"Vividly is the leading modern trade promotion management (TPM) solution built by and for the consumer packaged goods industry. From campaign creation to deductions management and promotion measurement, we help brands manage every element of trade spend. With our easy-to-use platform and industry-leading experience, we pride ourselves on our ability to bring businesses to the next level.


Not familiar with trade promotion spend? That’s OK. Most people aren’t. It’s an $8 trillion dollar problem that is ripe for disruption by an innovative SaaS startup. In order to grow, consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands spend 20% of their topline revenue to get into retailers and promote their products within those retailers. The problem is that today 70% of those promotions are not ROI positive. This is because ROI is hard to track. The industry operates on emails, pdfs, and xls spreadsheets. At Vividly, we’re solving this massive problem with exciting tactics including AI, Machine Learning, and Fintech and adding value to everyone in the chain. Some of our customers include brands you may use and love - Liquid Death, Amy’s, and Laird Superfoods.


Vividly is looking for a Product Manager to help us reach our goals!

As a product manager, you turn ambiguity into clarity by framing problems crisply, making smart trade-offs, and aligning teams around outcomes rather than output. You’re equally at home in discovery calls and sprint reviews, translating customer insight and data into clear priorities, requirements, and experiments. You influence without authority, communicate clearly with technical and non-technical partners, and keep stakeholders aligned through change. You care deeply about quality and reliability, and you’re energized by shipping pragmatic solutions that scale with our customers and the business.


The key responsibilities & impact this role will have:

Reporting to the VP of Product & Design you will own the end-to-end product lifecycle from discovery through requirements, build, launch, and iteration.
Be a part of a small but mighty team collaborating with Design, Engineers, Product Managers and other stakeholders to define problems, uncover user needs, and identify opportunities.
Plan and execute launches with Sales, Enablement, and Marketing creating release artifacts and enablement to drive adoption and customer value.
Partner in customer discovery. Develop expertise & empathy for our users, their needs, and how our product fits into their daily work. Build empathy across the team by sharing out research, facilitating workshops and advocating for user needs.
Translate complex user and business problems into crisp user stories and acceptance criteria, manage and prioritize the team backlog, and lead agile ceremonies.
Partner strongly with Engineering during implementation to ensure high-quality delivery and high velocity by working closely to make tradeoff decisions.
Uphold product quality and reliability by anticipating risks, contributing to QA of your products, and partnering with support to resolve customer issues.
Define and socialize a clear product vision, strategy, and multi-quarter roadmap for your area, aligned to company goals.


You will be successful with:

3+ years of professional experience in Product Management building SaaS based products. B2B experience preferred.
Proven track record of shipping end-to-end products and features with clear, measurable impact (adoption, retention, revenue).
Ability to turn ambiguity into crisp problem statements, briefs, and a prioritized multi-quarter roadmap.
Data savvy and familiarity with product analytics tooling.
Experience with APIs and successfully completing integrations with B2B customers.
Customer first mindset, skilled at discovery (interviews, surveys, shadowing) and translating insights into decisions and experiments.

&nbsp;","Job Summary

We are seeking a professional Azure Cloud Engineer and Administrator with a strong DevOps background to join our 30+ person ITS team at Hillsdale College. You will be responsible for designing, implementing, and managing cloud infrastructure that supports the College’s growing portfolio of web applications and microservices for its digital outreach platform that reach over 10 million people, including online.hillsdale.edu. Working closely with the College’s software development team, this role focuses on Microsoft Azure technologies, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), B2C authorization and authentication, Azure Front Door, networking, logging, and Application Insights. The role requires a strong focus on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure secure, scalable, and version-controlled, repeatable infrastructure deployments that can be reviewed, tested, and automatically deployed alongside application code.

You will work closely with our System Administrators who manage the College’s hybrid Azure and on-premises Active Directory environment. This position requires deep technical expertise in Azure services, IaC tools, and collaboration with Systems Administrators, Network Administrators, Service Desk, and Academic Support teams to maintain a reliable, standardized, and secure cloud ecosystem.

The ideal candidate will have five or more years of experience managing Azure cloud environments that host applications with over 5 million monthly active users, with at least one year in a lead or administrative role, and advanced skills in implementing IaC using tools like Terraform, ARM templates, or Bicep. Collaboration and continuous improvement with other IT teams are critical to aligning cloud infrastructure with the College’s academic and operational goals.

While technical proficiency is essential, the successful candidate must serve with humility and empathy, fostering cross-team collaboration, and driving continuous improvement to optimize cloud infrastructure and ensure compliance with security and operational standards.

Implement and refine ITIL-aligned processes (e.g., change management, incident management, configuration management) to ensure proactive cloud infrastructure administration and minimize service disruptions.
Collaborate with Systems Administrators, Network Administrators, Service Desk, and Academic Support teams to align cloud infrastructure with organizational needs and drive continuous improvement in IT service delivery.
Actively seek opportunities to automate repetitive cloud management tasks using IaC and scripting to increase efficiency, reduce errors, lower operating costs, and improve service levels.
Monitor and analyze key performance indicators (e.g., cloud uptime, resource utilization, security compliance, deployment success rates) to drive operational improvements and confirm value delivery.
Prepare and present reports for ITS leadership on cloud infrastructure health, security compliance, cost optimization, and performance metrics.
Review and support change requests to ensure minimal risk to cloud infrastructure stability and IT services.
Engage in at least 40 hours of continuing education annually to stay current with Azure services, IaC tools, cloud security practices, and ITIL methodologies.
